# cairn — Architecture

How the kernel is built and exactly how execution behaves. Companion to `CONCEPTS.md` (the model)
and `API.md` (the formats). Design constraint throughout: **a small, dependency-light kernel —
stdlib + `pyyaml` + `jsonschema` only; everything else is a plugin.** (With the hardening backlog in,
the kernel sits on the order of ~9,000 lines across roughly two dozen modules — several times the
initial ~2,500-line aspiration, but the two-dependency floor and the plugin boundary held.)

Dependency rule: **downward only.** Executors never read pipelines; the kernel never contains a CLI
name; the workspace is immutable during a run; all mutation lands in exactly one run dir.

The same picture as a control flow — how a `cairn run` moves through the kernel modules, and where
the guard engine sits relative to the executor it wraps:

```mermaid
graph LR
  CLI["cli.py<br/>plan · run · resume · …"] --> PLAN["plan.py<br/>load → verify → Plan"]
  PLAN --> WALK["walk.py<br/>the trail walker"]

  WALK --> COMPOSE["compose.py<br/>envelope (AX)"]
  WALK --> GATE["gatekit.py<br/>gate resolution"]
  WALK --> GUARD["guards.py<br/>hook · shim · post"]

  COMPOSE --> EX["executors/*<br/>claude · codex · grok · shell · stub"]

  ART -->|done predicate| WALK

  WALK --> TRAIL["trail.py<br/>trail.jsonl · the authority"]
  TRAIL --> SINKS["sinks.py<br/>jsonl (#0) · webhook tee"]
```

`plan.py` produces a static `Plan`; `walk.py` executes it, composing an envelope per step
(`compose.py`), resolving gates (`gatekit.py`), installing guards (`guards.py`), invoking a fresh
process (`executors/*`), and gating on artifact validity (`artifacts.py`) before appending to the
trail (`trail.py`) and teeing to any sinks (`sinks.py`).

## 2. Planning — `cairn plan`

Planning is a pure function: `(workspace, pipeline, params) → Plan | ConfigError`. Steps:

1. **Load & schema-check** `pipeline.yaml`, all referenced `agents/*.yaml`, `cairn.toml`.
2. **Resolve params** (types, defaults, required) → derive **dims** via the pipeline's preset table.
3. **Expand conditionals**: evaluate every `when:`/`unless:` that depends only on params/dims now;
   ones referencing artifact content stay as runtime predicates on the node.
4. **Verify dataflow**: walk nodes in order, tracking the set of produced artifact names. Any `needs`
   not in the set ⇒ `ConfigError` naming the step, the artifact, and the candidate producers. Any
   artifact produced twice (outside a loop) ⇒ error. Unused artifacts ⇒ warning.
5. **Verify references**: every agent file, skill dir, schema file, validator, guard checker exists;
   every expression parses; every tier is mapped for the chosen executor(s).
6. **Emit the Plan**: an ordered list of concrete nodes with resolved agent specs, executor
   assignment (global `--executor` + per-step overrides), model resolution, timeouts.

`plan` failing fast with file+line diagnostics *is* the DX headline: the entire class of "phase 4
crashed because phase 2's output name was typo'd" dies before a single token is spent.

## 3. Walking — the execution semantics

The walker consumes the Plan against a run dir. Per node kind:

### 3.1 `step`
```
1. done? → skip.           done(step) ⇔ ∀ a ∈ produces: exists(a) ∧ validate(a) = pass
2. needs check             ∀ a ∈ needs: done-produced or fail ConfigError (can't happen post-plan
                           except human deletion — checked anyway; disk is authority)
3. compose envelope        → runs/<id>/logs/<step>[.rN][.cK].prompt.md   (§6)
4. install guards          shims onto PATH; env: CAIRN_RUN_DIR, CAIRN_STEP, CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR…
5. executor.invoke()       fresh process, cwd = run dir, timeout, stdout/stderr → logs/<step>.log
6. parse STEP return       sentinel-framed JSON (§7); artifact validity is authority over it
7. validate produces       each artifact: schema then validator
8. record                  trail: done{step, artifacts, metrics} · run.json phase status
   on fail                 → retry? (attempts left: re-compose WITH validator reasons; goto 3)
                           → else halt (§3.5)
```

The same lifecycle as a state machine — note that *validate* is the only gate to *done*, and that
`cairn resume` re-enters a halted step at *compose*, never trusting a hand-edited artifact (§3.5):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> Done: already valid (done-skip)
  Pending --> Compose: not done · needs present
  Compose --> Execute: envelope rendered · guards installed
  Execute --> Validate: process returns · STEP parsed
  Validate --> Done: every produces passes
  Validate --> Retry: fail · attempts left
  Retry --> Compose: re-compose with validator reasons
  Validate --> Halt: fail · no attempts
  Halt --> Compose: cairn resume
  Done --> [*]
```

### 3.2 `gate`
Resolved decision at `gates/<name>.json`? → skip (this is what makes gates resumable and *never
re-asked*). Otherwise: a `--gate name=choice` preset resolves it (`by:"flag"`); interactive →
render question + artifact summary via the gate UI plugin (TTY default, `by:"tty"`); headless →
write the declared `default` (`by:"default"`). A `default` is **mandatory at plan time** (a gate
without one is a config error), so a headless run always resolves every gate and never blocks on
one. Either way the decision file is written first, then the trail `gate-answered` event. **No
model is ever mid-conversation during a gate** — gates live *between* processes.

### 3.3 `parallel`
`ThreadPoolExecutor(len(steps))` — each child step is its own OS process anyway; threads only
supervise. Group is done when all children are done. Failure policy `on_fail: wait_all | fast`
(default `wait_all`: let siblings finish, then halt — half-finished sibling artifacts remain valid
and resumable). Children must have disjoint `produces` (plan-time check).

### 3.4 `loop`
```
cycle = 1 + count(existing valid cycle artifacts)     # state derived from disk, nothing else
while cycle ≤ max[mode]:
    run body steps with {cycle} bound (artifact paths, prompts, expressions)
    if cycle ≥ min and eval(until): break
    cycle += 1
at cap without `until`: trail `loop-capped` + declared `on_cap: halt | continue` (brease art-review
uses continue — residual punch-list is recorded, pipeline proceeds to QA)
```
Loop state = which `…-r{cycle}` artifacts exist and validate. A resumed run recomputes the cycle
from disk — no counters stored anywhere.

### 3.5 Halt & resume
`halt` = trail event with `{node, reason, validator_reasons[], exit_code}`, partial artifacts left
in place, process exits with a distinct code (§9). **Resume is the retry mechanism:** `cairn resume`
re-plans with the recorded params (warning on pipeline content-hash drift, `--force` to accept),
then walks; every done node skips, the first not-done node re-executes. If the halt was a validator
failure and the step declares `retry.feedback`, the failed attempt's reasons are already in the
trail and get injected into the recomposed envelope.

**Operator note — don't hand-fix a halted step's artifact.** A node halted on validation is recorded
`halted`, and on resume a recorded halt outranks the artifact predicate: the step **re-runs and will
overwrite** any artifact a human edited in place, so the hand-fix is silently lost. The supported
path is to fix the *inputs* — the workspace, the upstream artifacts, or the step's config — and let
the step regenerate its output. (Answering an operator-blocked `manual`/`gate` out of band is the
one sanctioned by-hand action, because those halt as needs-human, not as a validation failure.)

### 3.6 `manual`
Print instructions + the validation criterion, wait for Enter (headless: halt with "requires
operator"), then validate `produces` like any step.

## 4. Guard enforcement matrix

Guards declare `enforce:` layers; the engine wires what each executor supports and *always* keeps
`post` on:

| Layer | Claude | Codex | Grok | shell |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hook` (native pre-tool block) | PreToolUse deny-JSON | PreToolUse deny-JSON *(hooks.json; fires headless — probe-verified on dev machine)* | PreToolUse deny-JSON or exit 2 *(grok 0.2.82; fires headless — probe-verified on dev machine)* | n/a |
| `shim` (PATH wrapper) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `post` (validator backstop) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

*Status: **`shim` + `post` enforce on a live run today.** `post` (the validator backstop) is the
walker's hard artifact gate, always on. `shim` is live too: for any plan carrying `shim`-enforced
guards, `cairn run`/`resume` builds a fresh per-run shim dir (`.cairn/shims`, via
`guards.build_shims`) and wraps every executor in a `GuardedExecutor` that prepends that dir to each
invocation's PATH (`cli.py:_wrap_guards`), so a guarded, PATH-resolved binary is intercepted before it
runs — independent of the hook layer. The `hook` layer now **installs for `claude`**:
`ClaudeExecutor.install_guards` writes `<run_dir>/.claude/settings.json` with a `PreToolUse` array whose
hook command runs `guards.py`'s `--hook-check` entry — the SAME guard chain (`_run_chain`) the shims run,
so a `hook`-enforced guard blocks a guarded `Bash` command before it executes (deny-JSON on stdout;
fail-closed on any error). A plan with no `hook`-enforced guards installs nothing. **`codex` and `grok`
install remain no-ops** — their `install_guards` does not yet wire native hooks, so for those two a
guarded command is still caught by the shim and the post validator, not by a native hook. (The
`--hook-check` install path is unit-tested; the live "claude actually blocks" fact is confirmed
per-machine by `cairn doctor --probe-hooks`, not by the unit suite.)*

*Both the shim and hook manifests (the guard decls a command is checked against) live OUTSIDE the run
dir in the gatekeys-protected state dir and are **authenticated**: a per-run HMAC over the manifest
content plus a sha256 of each check script, keyed by the run secret held outside the agent's write
scope (`gatekeys`). A sandboxed executor (codex `--sandbox workspace-write`) therefore cannot rewrite
the policy — the manifest is not in its cwd; and even under claude `bypassPermissions` (whole-FS write)
a rewritten manifest or a swapped check script **fails verification and denies** (fail-closed) unless
the agent also steals the run secret. What the `hook` does NOT do is widen the matcher: it uses the
SAME `fnmatch` glob as the shim, so an absolute-path / `sh -c` / `env`-prefixed / leading-space
invocation of a guarded binary MISSES the glob and is caught only by `post` — the hook does **not**
backstop the shim's absolute-path gap (corrected: earlier text claimed it did). Closing the claude
`bypassPermissions` residual outright (an OS FS-sandbox or tool-scoping so claude cannot read the run
secret or write outside the run dir) is tracked as **W3c**.*

**The C4 probe settles a specific burden.** The `claude` executor runs headless with
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (it must — see API §7 / SECURITY §1.2: the default mode refuses
every tool use and the guards are the enforcement layer instead of an interactive prompt). That made
`Capabilities.blocking_hooks = True` an **asserted design claim** whose whole containment story depends
on PreToolUse hooks *still firing AND still blocking* (exit 2) even under `bypassPermissions`. The C4
doctor hook-probe (`cairn doctor --probe-hooks`) now confirms exactly that empirically — and on the
dev machine it does: `claude` PreToolUse **fires+blocks** under `bypassPermissions`, so this open risk
is falsified where probed. `bypassPermissions` bypasses the interactive prompt but does **not** disable
hooks. This is a per-machine, per-CLI-version fact, not a universal guarantee: treat
`blocking_hooks=True` as the design's assumption and the probe as the standing per-machine check that
confirms it. (Codex's `blocking_hooks` stays `None` in code by design — the probe, not the capability
field, carries codex's per-machine truth.)

`cairn doctor --probe-hooks` empirically probes hook firing per executor — it spawns a throwaway canary
project carrying a native deny-hook, invokes the vendor CLI headlessly under the executor's real argv
posture and the walker's exact env baseline, and classifies the outcome (fires+blocks / fires-not-blocks
/ no-fire / inconclusive) — so the port design's highest risk becomes a diagnosed, per-machine fact instead
of an assumption. On the dev machine all three vendor executors probe **hook-primary**: `claude`,
`codex` (codex-cli 0.142.5 *does* ship native PreToolUse blocking hooks), and `grok` (grok 0.2.82:
PreToolUse fires+blocks under `bypassPermissions`). One posture caveat is grok-specific: a grok hook
denies only via `{"decision":"deny"}` on stdout (honored regardless of exit code) or exit 2 — **every
other hook failure (crash, timeout, malformed output) fails OPEN**, so for grok the shim and `post`
layers are the backstop against a broken hook, not just a bypassed one. The check script contract is
one file, one convention (exit 0/2), reused across all three layers.

## 5. Isolation & environment

Each invocation gets: `cwd = run dir`; env `CAIRN_RUN_DIR`, `CAIRN_STEP`, `CAIRN_WORKSPACE`
(+ `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for compat) — **per-process env, no global pointer file**, so N concurrent
runs are safe by construction; the executor's own sandbox flags (`--sandbox workspace-write`,
`--cwd`, permission mode) from its config; the guard shims prepended to PATH. The envelope states
the isolation rule and the wrong-run tripwire (assert `run.json.params.url` matches) — belt over
the environment's suspenders, unchanged from today.

## 6. The envelope — AX as a specification

`compose.py` renders **the same six blocks, in the same order, for every agent step on every
executor**, to a file that is part of the run record:

```
1 MISSION    you are <agent> executing <step> of <pipeline> · run dir (absolute) · tripwire
2 CONTRACT   inputs: each `needs` artifact — absolute path + one-line description
             outputs: each `produces` — absolute path + schema path + acceptance criteria text
             (+ on retry: "previous attempt failed validation: <reasons>")
3 SKILLS     full SKILL.md bodies for the agent's skills (deterministic inlining, §CONCEPTS.7)
4 TRAIL      last N trail events + top-K learnings (the read-before brief)
5 DOCTRINE   the workspace doctrine slice (isolation, invariants, guard notice)
6 RETURN     the STEP protocol (§7) + "your final message is data, not prose"
```

AX principles, enforceable because composition is code:
- **Absolute paths, always.** No agent ever resolves a relative path.
- **Contract over instruction.** Acceptance criteria are copied from the artifact declarations —
  the agent reads the same text the validator enforces.
- **Nothing hidden.** If it isn't in the envelope or at a declared path, it doesn't exist. No
  reliance on any CLI's auto-context.
- **Schemas are readable.** The envelope points at schema files the agent can open — models produce
  dramatically better JSON when shown the schema.
- **Failure is informative.** Retries carry validator reasons verbatim; the agent never guesses
  what was wrong.
- **One job.** One step, one contract, one return. Anything bigger is the pipeline's job.

## 7. The STEP return protocol

Final-message contract, executor-independent. (Codex's native `--output-schema` is *reserved* as a
future bonus where available, never relied on — the built CodexExecutor does not wire it yet; the
sentinel block below is the sole contract on every executor today.)

```
<<<STEP
{ "status": "done | skipped | blocked",
  "summary": "one paragraph",
  "artifacts": ["captures/site-map.json", ...],
  "metrics":  { "pages": 19 },
  "learnings": [ { "note": "...", "tag": "capture" } ],
  "blockers":  [ "..." ] }
STEP>>>
```

Sentinel-framed so it survives chatty models. Parse policy (authority rule): artifacts valid +
STEP unparsable → warn, continue. Artifacts invalid → halt regardless of what STEP claims.
`status: skipped` + a skip reason is how self-skipping steps (asset-gen with no gap) record
themselves — trail `skip` event, `produces` exempted via `skippable: true`.

## 8. Batch & composition

`cairn batch` is **not a kernel concept**: it's a bounded process pool (`-j`) of independent
`cairn run` invocations, one params-set each, each in its own run dir. All gates resolve to
defaults (or `--gate scope=all` presets). The same recursion works upward: a `cairn run` is itself
one deterministic command, so a *different* pipeline — or an interactive agent session — can invoke
it as a tool. Composition happens above the pipeline, never inside a step.

## 9. Exit codes & failure taxonomy

| Code | Meaning | Typical actor response |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | run complete | — |
| 2 | config error (plan-time) | fix workspace file named in the error |
| 3 | artifact gate failed | read validator reasons → `cairn resume` |
| 4 | executor failure (spawn/auth/crash); also: run-lock contention (run is held by PID …) | `cairn doctor`, then resume |
| 5 | timeout | inspect `logs/<step>.log`, resume |
| 6 | needs a human: a `manual:` step in headless mode, or an interactive gate whose TTY was closed/interrupted (headless gates can't reach here — their `default` is mandatory) | answer externally (`cairn gate <run> <name>=<choice>`) or preset (`--gate`), then resume — the operator-pattern hook for coding agents |
| 7 | budget exceeded (`SECURITY.md` §4) | raise the cap or accept the partial run, then resume |

## 10. Reproducibility

`run.json` records: pipeline content-hash, workspace git rev (if any), cairn version, executor
versions (`codex --version` …), resolved model IDs per step (date-pinned where the vendor allows),
params, dims. `cairn resume` warns on any drift. Two runs with equal hashes and params differ only
by model nondeterminism — the maximum honesty possible in this domain.

## 11. Extension points (the pi-mono discipline)

Small kernel; five sanctioned plugin surfaces, each a tiny protocol + entry-point registration:

| Surface | Protocol | Built-ins | Examples of later plugins |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Executor** | 5 ops (`API.md §6`) | claude, codex, grok, shell, stub (test replay — `TESTING.md §5`) | cursor, opencode, raw-API |
| **Gate UI** | `ask(question, options, context) → choice` | TTY | web panel, Slack approval |
| **Trail sink** | `emit(event)` (tee — never authority; bounded retry, cannot slow a run) | jsonl, webhook | OTel exporter, Slack, desktop notify (`OBSERVABILITY.md` §2) |
| **Validator** | any executable, exit 0/1 + reasons | — | language-agnostic by design |
| **Guard check** | any executable, exit 0/2 + reason | — | same |

Nothing else is pluggable **on purpose** — node kinds, envelope block order, the STEP protocol, and
run-dir layout are fixed. That fixedness is what makes every cairn workspace legible to every tool
(and every agent) that has seen one before.
